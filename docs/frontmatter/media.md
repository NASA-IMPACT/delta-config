# media
`object`  
Controls the image used to identify this resource. This image will show up in the cards and whenever thereâ€™s the need to visually identify the resource. 

Consider optimizing your image by adjusting quality resizing the size with  before using it. 


You can use the tools like below to optimize your image.

### GUI
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac)
- [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io/)

### CLI
- [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
- [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/)
  
This is an example one liner command that resizes `example.png` to 70% of the original size, drops the quality then compresses it  (using  both `imagemagick` and `pngquant`). Tweak the parameters as needed. 

`mogrify -resize 70% -quality 70 example.png && pngquant example.png --ext .png --force`

**src**  
`string | fileSrc`  
The source for the image. Can be an absolute url like `https://example.com/img.png` or a reference to a local file. Whenever using a local file the value must be prefixed with `::file` to instruct the app how to load the file.
Example:
```yaml
media:
  src: ::file ./img-placeholder-4.jpg
```

**alt**  
`string`  
Alternative description for the image.  
Used when it is not possible to view the image, because it failed loading or when a user it using a screen reader. Should be a meaningful description.

**author**  
`object`  
Allows you to give credits to the image author by providing a `name` and an optional `url` to link to. It will normally be displayed as a info icon on top of images.
Example:
```yaml
media:
  author:
    name: Lorem Picsum
    url: https://unsplash.com/
```
